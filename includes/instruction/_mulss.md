 Op/En| Operand 1       | Operand 2    | Operand 3    | Operand 4
 ---  | --- | --- | --- | ---
 RM   | ModRM:reg (r, w)| ModRM:r/m (r)| NA           | NA       
 RVM  | ModRM:reg (w)   | VEX.vvvv (r) | ModRM:r/m (r)| NA       

### Description
Multiplies the low single-precision floating-point value from the source operand
(second operand) by the low single-precision floating-point value in the destination
operand (first operand), and stores the single-precision floating-point result
in the destination operand. The source operand can be an XMM register or a 32-bit
memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. The three high-order
doublewords of the destination operand remain unchanged. See Figure 10-6 in
the IntelÂ® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 1,
for an illustration of a scalar single-precision floating-point operation.

In 64-bit mode, use of the REX.R prefix permits this instruction to access additional
registers (XMM8-XMM15). 128-bit Legacy SSE version: The first source operand
and the destination operand are the same. Bits (VLMAX1:32) of the corresponding
YMM destination register remain unchanged. VEX.128 encoded version: Bits (VLMAX-1:128)
of the destination YMM register are zeroed.
