## SUBSS - Subtract Scalar Single-Precision Floating-Point Values

> Operation

``` slim
SUBSS (128-bit Legacy SSE version)
DEST[31:0] <- DEST[31:0] - SRC[31:0]
DEST[VLMAX-1:32] (Unmodified)
VSUBSS (VEX.128 encoded version)

### Description
Subtracts the low single-precision floating-point value in the source operand
(second operand) from the low singleprecision floating-point value in the destination
operand (first operand), and stores the single-precision floatingpoint result
in the destination operand. The source operand can be an XMM register or a 32-bit
memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. The three high-order
doublewords of the destination operand remain unchanged. See Figure 10-6 in
the IntelÂ® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 1,
for an illustration of a scalar single-precision floating-point operation.

In 64-bit mode, using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits this instruction
to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15). 128-bit Legacy SSE version: The
destination and first source operand are the same. Bits (VLMAX-1:32) of the
### corresponding YMM destination register remain unchanged. VEX.128 encoded version
Bits (127:32) of the XMM register destination are copied from corresponding
bits in the first source operand. Bits (VLMAX-1:128) of the destination YMM
register are zeroed.
