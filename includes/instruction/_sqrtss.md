### Description
Computes the square root of the low single-precision floating-point value in
the source operand (second operand) and stores the single-precision floating-point
result in the destination operand. The source operand can be an XMM register
or a 32-bit memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. The
three high-order doublewords of the destination operand remain unchanged. See
Figure 10-6 in the IntelÂ® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual,
Volume 1, for an illustration of a scalar single-precision floating-point operation.

In 64-bit mode, using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits this instruction
to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15). 128-bit Legacy SSE version: The
first source operand and the destination operand are the same. Bits (VLMAX1:32)
of the corresponding YMM destination register remain unchanged. VEX.128 encoded
version: Bits (VLMAX-1:128) of the destination YMM register are zeroed.
