### Description
Compares the single-precision floating-point values in the low doublewords of
operand 1 (first operand) and operand 2 (second operand), and sets the ZF, PF,
and CF flags in the EFLAGS register according to the result (unordered, greater
than, less than, or equal). The OF, SF, and AF flags in the EFLAGS register
are set to 0. The unordered result is returned if either source operand is a
NaN (QNaN or SNaN). The sign of zero is ignored for comparisons, so that -0.0
is equal to +0.0.

Operand 1 is an XMM register; Operand 2 can be an XMM register or a 32 bit memory
location.

The COMISS instruction differs from the UCOMISS instruction in that it signals
a SIMD floating-point invalid operation exception (#I) when a source operand
is either a QNaN or SNaN. The UCOMISS instruction signals an invalid numeric
exception only if a source operand is an SNaN.

The EFLAGS register is not updated if an unmasked SIMD floating-point exception
is generated.

In 64-bit mode, use of the REX.R prefix permits this instruction to access additional
registers (XMM8-XMM15). Note: In VEX-encoded versions, VEX.vvvv is reserved
and must be 1111b, otherwise instructions will #UD.
