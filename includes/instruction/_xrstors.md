### Description
Performs a full or partial restore of processor state components from the XSAVE
area located at the memory address specified by the source operand. The implicit
EDX:EAX register pair specifies a 64-bit instruction mask. The specific state
components restored correspond to the bits set in the requested-feature bitmap
(RFBM), which is the logical-AND of EDX:EAX and the logical-OR of XCR0 with
the IA32_XSS MSR. XRSTORS may be executed only if CPL = 0.

The format of the XSAVE area is detailed in Section 13.4, “XSAVE Area,” of Intel®
64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 1.

Section 13.11, “Operation of XRSTORS,” of Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures
Software Developer's Manual, Volume 1 provides a detailed description of the
operation of the XRSTOR instruction. The following items provide a high-level
### outline

 - Execution of XRSTORS is similar to that of the compacted form of XRSTOR; XRSTORS
cannot restore from an XSAVE area in which the extended region is in the standard
format (see Section 13.4.3, “Extended Region of an XSAVE Area”).
 - XRSTORS differs from XRSTOR in that it can restore state components corresponding
to bits set in the IA32_XSS MSR.
 - If RFBM[i] = 0, XRSTORS does not update state component i.
 - If RFBM[i] = 1 and bit i is clear in the XSTATE_BV field in the XSAVE header,
XRSTORS initializes state component i.
 - If RFBM[i] = 1 and XSTATE_BV[i] = 1, XRSTORS loads state component i from the
XSAVE area.
 - If XRSTORS attempts to load MXCSR with an illegal value, a general-protection
exception (**``#GP)``** occurs.
 - XRSTORS loads the internal value XRSTOR_INFO, which may be used to optimize
a subsequent execution of XSAVEOPT or XSAVES.
 - Immediately following an execution of XRSTORS, the processor tracks as in-use
(not in initial configuration) any state component i for which RFBM[i] = 1 and
XSTATE_BV[i] = 1; it tracks as modified any state component i for which RFBM[i]
= 0.

Use of a source operand not aligned to 64-byte boundary (for 64-bit and 32-bit
modes) results in a general-protection (**``#GP)``** exception. In 64-bit mode, the
upper 32 bits of RDX and RAX are ignored.



### Protected Mode Exceptions
   | |  
---- | -----
 **``#GP(0)``**         | If CPL > 0. If a memory operand effective
                | address is outside the CS, DS, ES, FS,   
                | or GS segment limit. If a memory operand 
                | is not aligned on a 64-byte boundary,    
                | regardless of segment. If bit 63 of      
                | the XCOMP_BV field of the XSAVE header   
                | is 0. If a bit in XCR0 is 0 and the      
                | corresponding bit in the XCOMP_BV field  
                | of the XSAVE header is 1. If a bit in    
                | the XCOMP_BV field in the XSAVE header   
                | is 0 and the corresponding bit in the    
                | XSTATE_BV field is 1. If bytes 63:16     
                | of the XSAVE header are not all zero.    
                | If attempting to write any reserved      
                | bits of the MXCSR register with 1.       
 **``#SS(0)``**         | If a memory operand effective address    
                | is outside the SS segment limit.         
 **``#PF(fault-code)``**| If a page fault occurs.                  
 **``#NM``**            | If CR0.TS[bit 3] = 1.                    
 **``#UD``**            | If CPUID.01H:ECX.XSAVE[bit 26] = 0 or    
                | CPUID.(EAX=0DH,ECX=1):EAX.XSS[bit 3]     
                | = 0. If CR4.OSXSAVE[bit 18] = 0. If      
                | any of the LOCK, 66H, F3H or F2H prefixes
                | is used.                                 
 **``#AC``**            | If this exception is disabled a general  
                | protection exception (**``#GP)``** is signaled   
                | if the memory operand is not aligned     
                | on a 16-byte boundary, as described      
                | above. If the alignment check            
exception (**``#AC)``** is enabled (and the CPL is 3), signaling of **``#AC``** is not guaranteed
and may vary with implementation, as follows. In all implementations where **``#AC``**
is not signaled, a **``#GP``** is signaled in its place. In addition, the width of the
alignment check may also vary with implementation. For instance, for a given
implementation, an alignment check exception might be signaled for a 2-byte
misalignment, whereas a **``#GP``** might be signaled for all other misalignments (4-,
8-, or 16-byte misalignments).
