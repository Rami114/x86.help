### Instruction Operand Encoding

### Description
Decrements the stack pointer by 4 (if the current operand-size attribute is
32) and pushes the entire contents of the EFLAGS register onto the stack, or
decrements the stack pointer by 2 (if the operand-size attribute is 16) and
pushes the lower 16 bits of the EFLAGS register (that is, the FLAGS register)
onto the stack. These instructions reverse the operation of the POPF/POPFD instructions.

When copying the entire EFLAGS register to the stack, the VM and RF flags (bits
16 and 17) are not copied; instead, the values for these flags are cleared in
the EFLAGS image stored on the stack. See Chapter 3 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32
Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 1, for more information about
the EFLAGS register.

The PUSHF (push flags) and PUSHFD (push flags double) mnemonics reference the
same opcode. The PUSHF instruction is intended for use when the operand-size
attribute is 16 and the PUSHFD instruction for when the operand-size attribute
is 32. Some assemblers may force the operand size to 16 when PUSHF is used and
to 32 when PUSHFD is used. Others may treat these mnemonics as synonyms (PUSHF/PUSHFD)
and use the current setting of the operand-size attribute to determine the size
of values to be pushed from the stack, regardless of the mnemonic used.

In 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operation is to decrement the stack
pointer (RSP) by 8 and pushes RFLAGS on the stack. 16-bit operation is supported
using the operand size override prefix 66H. 32-bit operand size cannot be encoded
in this mode. When copying RFLAGS to the stack, the VM and RF flags (bits 16
and 17) are not copied; instead, values for these flags are cleared in the RFLAGS
image stored on the stack.

When in virtual-8086 mode and the I/O privilege level (IOPL) is less than 3,
the PUSHF/PUSHFD instruction causes a general protection exception (#GP).

In the real-address mode, if the ESP or SP register is 1 when PUSHF/PUSHFD instruction
executes: an #SS exception is generated but not delivered (the stack error reported
prevents #SS delivery). Next, the processor generates a #DF exception and enters
a shutdown state as described in the #DF discussion in Chapter 6 of the Intel®
64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 3A.
