### Description
Pops a doubleword (POPFD) from the top of the stack (if the current operand-size
attribute is 32) and stores the value in the EFLAGS register, or pops a word
from the top of the stack (if the operand-size attribute is 16) and stores it
in the lower 16 bits of the EFLAGS register (that is, the FLAGS register). These
instructions reverse the operation of the PUSHF/PUSHFD instructions.

The POPF (pop flags) and POPFD (pop flags double) mnemonics reference the same
opcode. The POPF instruction is intended for use when the operand-size attribute
is 16; the POPFD instruction is intended for use when the operand-size attribute
is 32. Some assemblers may force the operand size to 16 for POPF and to 32 for
POPFD. Others may treat the mnemonics as synonyms (POPF/POPFD) and use the setting
of the operand-size attribute to determine the size of values to pop from the
stack.

The effect of POPF/POPFD on the EFLAGS register changes, depending on the mode
of operation. When the processor is operating in protected mode at privilege
level 0 (or in real-address mode, the equivalent to privilege level 0), all
non-reserved flags in the EFLAGS register except RF1, VIP, VIF, and VM may be
modified. VIP, VIF and VM remain unaffected.

When operating in protected mode with a privilege level greater than 0, but
less than or equal to IOPL, all flags can be modified except the IOPL field
and VIP, VIF, and VM. Here, the IOPL flags are unaffected, the VIP and VIF flags
are cleared, and the VM flag is unaffected. The interrupt flag (IF) is altered
only when executing at a level at least as privileged as the IOPL. If a POPF/POPFD
instruction is executed with insufficient privilege, an exception does not occur
but privileged bits do not change.

When operating in virtual-8086 mode, the IOPL must be equal to 3 to use POPF/POPFD
instructions; VM, RF, IOPL, VIP, and VIF are unaffected. If the IOPL is less
than 3, POPF/POPFD causes a general-protection exception (#GP).

In 64-bit mode, use REX.W to pop the top of stack to RFLAGS. The mnemonic assigned
is POPFQ (note that the 32bit operand is not encodable). POPFQ pops 64 bits
from the stack, loads the lower 32 bits into RFLAGS, and zero extends the upper
bits of RFLAGS.

See Chapter 3 of the IntelÂ® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's
Manual, Volume 1, for more information about the EFLAGS registers.

### Compatibility Mode Exceptions
Same as for protected mode exceptions.


### 64-Bit Mode Exceptions
