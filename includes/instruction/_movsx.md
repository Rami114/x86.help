<aside class="notification">
\* In 64-bit mode, r/m8 can not be encoded to access the following byte
registers if a REX prefix is used: AH, BH, CH, DH. \*\* The use of MOVSXD without
REX.W in 64-bit mode is discouraged, Regular MOV should be used instead of using
MOVSXD without REX.W.

### Instruction Operand Encoding
 Op/En| Operand 1    | Operand 2    | Operand 3| Operand 4
 ---  | --- | --- | --- | ---
 RM   | ModRM:reg (w)| ModRM:r/m (r)| NA       | NA       

### Description
Copies the contents of the source operand (register or memory location) to the
destination operand (register) and sign extends the value to 16 or 32 bits (see
Figure 7-6 in the IntelÂ® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual,
Volume 1). The size of the converted value depends on the operand-size attribute.

In 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operation size is 32 bits. Use of
the REX.R prefix permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Use of the
REX.W prefix promotes operation to 64 bits. See the summary chart at the beginning
of this section for encoding data and limits.



### Flags Affected
None.

    | segment limit.                       
 #SS| If a memory operand effective address
    | is outside the SS segment limit.     
 #UD| If the LOCK prefix is used.          

### Virtual-8086 Mode Exceptions
   | |  
---- | -----
 #GP(0)         | If a memory operand effective address
                | is outside the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS 
                | segment limit.

### Compatibility Mode Exceptions
Same exceptions as in protected mode.


### 64-Bit Mode Exceptions
   | |  
---- | -----
