### Description
Subtracts the low double-precision floating-point value in the source operand
(second operand) from the low double-precision floating-point value in the destination
operand (first operand), and stores the double-precision floating-point result
in the destination operand. The source operand can be an XMM register or a 64-bit
memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. The high quadword
of the destination operand remains unchanged. See Figure 11-4 in the IntelÂ®
64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 1, for an illustration
of a scalar double-precision floating-point operation.

In 64-bit mode, using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits this instruction
to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15). 128-bit Legacy SSE version: The
destination and first source operand are the same. Bits (VLMAX-1:64) of the
### corresponding YMM destination register remain unchanged. VEX.128 encoded version
Bits (127:64) of the XMM register destination are copied from corresponding
bits in the first source operand. Bits (VLMAX-1:128) of the destination YMM
register are zeroed.
