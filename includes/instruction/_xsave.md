### Description
Performs a full or partial save of processor state components to the XSAVE area
located at the memory address specified by the destination operand. The implicit
EDX:EAX register pair specifies a 64-bit instruction mask. The specific state
components saved correspond to the bits set in the requested-feature bitmap
(RFBM), which is the logical-AND of EDX:EAX and XCR0.

The format of the XSAVE area is detailed in Section 13.4, “XSAVE Area,” of Intel®
64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 1.

Section 13.6, “Operation of XSAVE,” of Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software
Developer's Manual, Volume 1 provides a detailed description of the operation
### of the XSAVE instruction. The following items provide a high-level outline

 - XSAVE saves state component i if and only if RFBM[i] = 1.1
 - XSAVE does not modify bytes 511:464 of the legacy region of the XSAVE area (see
Section 13.4.1, “Legacy Region of an XSAVE Area”).
 - XSAVE reads the XSTATE_BV field of the XSAVE header (see Section 13.4.2, “XSAVE
Header”) and writes a modified value back to memory as follows. If RFBM[i] =
1, XSAVE writes XSTATE_BV[i] with the value of XINUSE[i]. (XINUSE is a bitmap
by which the processor tracks the status of various state components. See Section
13.5.4, “Processor Tracking of XSAVE-Managed State.”) If RFBM[i] = 0, XSAVE
writes XSTATE_BV[i]with the value that it read from memory (it does not modify
the bit). XSAVE does not write to any part of the XSAVE header other than the
XSTATE_BV field.
 - XSAVE always uses the standard format of the extended region of the XSAVE area
(see Section 13.4.3, “Extended Region of an XSAVE Area”).

Use of a destination operand not aligned to 64-byte boundary (in either 64-bit
or 32-bit modes) results in a general-protection (#GP) exception. In 64-bit
mode, the upper 32 bits of RDX and RAX are ignored.



### Flags Affected
None.

                | protection exception might be signaled       
                | for all other misalignments (4-, 8-,
